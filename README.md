# flutter_playround

First experimentation with Flutter.

In this example I've; 

* Created a Flutter app from the ground up.
* Written Dart code.
* Leveraged an external, third party library.
* Used hot reload for a faster development cycle.
* Implemented a stateful widget, adding interactivity to your app.
* Created a lazily loaded, infinite scrolling list displayed with a ListView and ListTiles.
* Created a route and added logic for moving between the home route and the new route.
* Learned about changing the look of your appâ€™s UI using Themes.

Coding along with the 'Getting Started' section of the Flutter Documentation; https://flutter.io/get-started/codelab/
